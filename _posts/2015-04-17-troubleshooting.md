This page lists some common errors that may occur during the compilation stage.

<br>

#### "ERROR : Generating calculus .scala file failed!"
This error is most probably caused by an error in the ``<calculus_name>_Core.thy`` Isabelle file. Try re-running the script in verbose mode (using ``-v`` flag) and check for the specific error output generated by Isabelle.
To get rid of most errors without modifying the Isabelle files, try the ``--dirty`` **!!!! NOT IMPLEMENTED !!!!** flag when building.

<br>

#### "ERROR : Missing the core calculus file! Try re-builidng with -f to rebuild the calculus"
This error is similar to the one above. The core calculus theory file is probably missing. rebuild with ``-f`` flag.

<br>

#### "ERROR : Generating calculus rules .scala file failed!"
This error is most probably caused by an error in the ``<calculus_name>.thy`` Isabelle file. Try re-running the script in verbose mode (using ``-v`` flag) and check for the specific error output generated by Isabelle.
To get rid of most errors without modifying the Isabelle files, try the ``--dirty`` **!!!! NOT IMPLEMENTED !!!!** flag when building.
