The calculus toolbox has been designed around a special class of logics called _display calculi_, first introduced by Nuel Belnap as Display Logic. These logics are easily modified and extended, meaning that this toolbox, which is based around the aforementioned calculi can be very flexible.

The need for a toolbox for display calculi arose from the formalization of set calculi in the theorem prover Isabelle. The initial implementation of was a minimal calculus adapted from the D.EAK calculus described in the paper by A.Kurz, et al. This version of the calculus only contained a small subset of rules and connectives of the full calculus and was used to test out the implementation of such calculi in Isabelle.

Initially, a shallow embedding (abbreviated SE) of the calculus was formalized in Isabelle, however, with the aim of formalizing the cut elimination proof for the D.EAK calculus, it was soon discovered that the SE would not be sufficient and a deep embedding (abbreviated DE) of the calculus would be needed.

### Basic Structure of a display calculus

The terms of the minimal display calculus are inductively built from atomic propositions, composed into formulas, which are in turn composed into structures. a valid term of a calculus is a sequent composed of two structures on either side of a turnstile: \\( X \vdash Y \\), with the left structure \\(X\\) referred to as the antecedent of the sequent and the right part \\(Y\\) being the consequent/succedent. The definitions of the minimal calculus formula and structure terms are given below:

{:.table .noborder .centering .equal-cols-2}
| \\( F:= ap \in \mathsf{AtProp} \mid F \land F \mid F \rightarrow F \\) | \\( S:= F \mid \mathsf{Id} \mid S \,; S \mid S > S \\) |

### Shallow embedding

Both the shallow and the deep embedding follow a similar structure of formalization in Isabelle. Firstly, there is the inductive definition of the terms of the calculus, formalized via Isabelle's ⊢datatype` definition (formula terms defined in the previous section):

~~~
datatype formula = Atprop atProp
                 | And_F formula formula  (infix "∧F" 570)
                 | ImpR_F formula formula (infix "→F" 550)
~~~

Whereas in the abstract definition, the set of atomic propositions is not specifically defined, in the SE, we have chosen to use strings for atomic propositions:

~~~json
type_synonym atProp = string
~~~

To keep things easily readable even in the Isabelle notation, syntactic sugar is introduced via the `infix` keyword, which allows infix syntax for the constructors of the Formula datatype.  
Thus, a simple formula such as \\( p \land p \\), written as `And_F (Atprop ’’p’’) (Atprop ’’p’’)` in Isabelle syntax without the syntactic sugar, can also be written as `Atprop ’’p’’ ∧F Atprop ’’p’’` using the infix `∧F` constructor, instead of the `And_F` one.  
Structures and Sequents of the calculus have been formalized in the SE in a similar fashion.

The next important part of the formalization is the notion of derivability of a sequent in a calculus. Isabelle provides facilities for inductively defining derivability through the `inductive` definition (note the following code snippet is not the full definition of derivable in the minimal calculus):

~~~
inductive derivable :: "sequent ⇒ bool" ("⊢d _" 300)
where
    Id: "⊢d Form (Atprop p) ⊢ Form (Atprop p)"
  | I_impR: " ⊢d (X ⊢ Y) ⟹ ⊢d (I ⊢ X>>Y)"
  | I_impR2: " ⊢d (I ⊢ X>>Y) ⟹ ⊢d (X ⊢ Y)"
  | ImpR_I: " ⊢d (X ⊢ Y) ⟹ ⊢d (Y>>X ⊢ I)"
  | ImpR_I2: " ⊢d (Y>>X ⊢ I) ⟹ ⊢d (X ⊢ Y)"
  | IW_L: " ⊢d (I ⊢ X) ⟹ ⊢d (Y ⊢ X)"
  | IW_R: " ⊢d (X ⊢ I) ⟹ ⊢d (X ⊢ Y)"
  ...
~~~

### Deep embedding

Whilst the core SE implementation is quite short, it lacks features needed for the cut elimination proof, namely an explicit notion of proof trees.  
Even though a derivable sequent always has a derivation tree, in SE, this tree is only implicitly encoded in Isabelle and cannot be accessed easily.  
The inductive definition of the rules in the SE automatically generate rewrite rules of the same form, using Isabelle meta-variables along with the internal Isabelle pattern matching and rule application. Since these mechanisms are embedded deep within Isabelle's core, they are not easy to reason about and manipulate explicitly, as seen below in the proof tree for the derived weakening rule in the minimal calculus:

\\[\frac{\displaystyle \frac
{X \vdash Y}
{Y > X \vdash Z} }
{X \vdash Y ; Z}\\]

Note that since the proof tree is derived bottom-to-top, but we write proofs top-to-bottom in a text editor, the Isabelle proof is inverted: 

~~~json
lemma W_R: 
assumes "⊢d X ⊢ Y"
shows "⊢d X ⊢ Y;Z"              (* goal: ⊢d X ⊢ Y;Z  *)
apply (rule ImpR_comma_disp2)   (* goal: ⊢d Y>>X ⊢ Z *)
apply (rule W_impR_L)           (* goal: ⊢d X ⊢ Y    *)
apply (rule assms)              (* done              *)
~~~

Since the notion of a proof tree in SE is very abstract as it is encoded using Isabelle's own proof environment, and the cut elimination proof for the display calculi needs an explicit way of manipulating proof trees, the DE version of the calculus introduces a different encoding that allows explicit reasoning with and manipulation of proof trees.  
In order to encode proof trees, the notion of derivability had to be rewritten more explicitly.

A proof tree in the DE is an term (using Isabelle's `datatype`), just like a sequent or a formula, with the desired derived sequent at its conclusion/root and intermediate steps/derivations forming its branches. The validity of such proof tree is determined by checking the derivation of the conclusion of every sub-tree from its branches.  
This, in turn introduces the need for explicit pattern matching of sequents and rules and thus the introduction of free variables to the aforementioned data structures of the SE.

Firstly, the DE will have a new constructor for each term form the SE. For example, an atomic proposition in DE will now have two terms, the original one (_Atprop_) and an extra free variable term (*Atprop_Freevar*).
