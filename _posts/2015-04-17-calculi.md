The calculus toolbox has been designed around a special class of logics called _display calculi_, first introduced by Nuel Belnap as Display Logic. These logics are easily modified and extended, meaning that this toolbox, which is based around the aforementioned calculi can be very flexible.

The need for a toolbox for display calculi arose from the formalization of set calculi in the theorem prover Isabelle. The initial implementation of was a minimal calculus adapted from the D.EAK calculus described in the paper by A.Kurz, et al. This version of the calculus only contained a small subset of rules and connectives of the full calculus and was used to test out the implementation of such calculi in Isabelle.

Initially, a shallow embedding (abbreviated SE) of the calculus was formalized in Isabelle, however, with the aim of formalizing the cut elimination proof for the D.EAK calculus, it was soon discovered that the SE would not be sufficient and a deep embedding (abbreviated DE) of the calculus would be needed.

### Basic Structure of a display calculus



### Shallow embedding

Both the shallow and the deep embedding follow a similar structure of formalization in Isabelle. Firstly, there is the inductive definition of the terms of the calculus, defined via Isabelle `datatype` definition.
