The calculus toolbox is a set of scripts and utilities for generating a custom set of Isabelle theory files and scala classes that provide a user interface for working with set calculi.

### System overview

The specification of a calculus file is contained within a JSON file. This file contains the full specification of the structure of the calculus, as well as the encoding of the rules of the calculus. The specifics on the JSON file s6tructure can be found HERE.

The `utilities` folder contains the core scripts for generating the Isabelle theory files and the scala UI. Detailed description of these tools can be found HERE.

Finally, the generated Scala and Isabelle files are documented in HERE.
