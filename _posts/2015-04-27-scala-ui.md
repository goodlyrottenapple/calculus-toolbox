### UI Overview
After generating the calculus and [recompiling]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/introduction.html#compile-step) all the UI classes, running `make gui` inside the generated calculus should produce the window below.

![scala gui screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/gh-pages/_files/scala_gui_screen1.png)

The bar at the top, containing the text input field, is used by the user to input sequents into the UI. The user uses ASCII and if the input can be parsed, it is [typeset](#latex-typesetting) in LaTeX for better readability. Pressing Enter after the user entered a valid sequent will launch the [proof search](#proof-search). If the proof search is successful, the resulting proof tree found is displayed in the panel below. The UI allows the user to interactively modify the proof trees by clicking on any of the sequents in the tree:

![scala gui screenshot, pt close up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/gh-pages/_files/scala_gui_screen2.png)


Each sequent in the proof tree can be clicked on and the proof tree can be modified at this point. The options, listed in the drop down menu shown above, are described in more detail in the following table:

{: .table .table-responsive}
Copy                  | Copies the selected sequent as an ASCII string
Add&nbsp;as&nbsp;assm | Adds the selected sequent to the list of assumptions
Merge&nbsp;above      | Looks at all the generated proof trees in the session (shown in a list on the right), searching for a proof tree with a conclusion which matches the selected sequent. If such a proof tree is found, it is copied into the current one and merged at the selected sequent. Note that the selected sequent must be a leaf of the tree. (To make the selected sequent a leaf, use the option `Delete above`)
FindPT                | This option will start a [proof search](#proof-search) with the selected sequent as the goal/target. If a proof tree is found, it is automatically added into the current proof tree.
Add&nbsp;above        | If the selected sequent is a leaf in the proof tree, add above will open a dialog window with a list of all applicable rules for the selected sequent:<br>![scala gui screenshot, pt close up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/gh-pages/_files/scala_gui_screen3.png)<br>Selecting a rule form the list will apply the rule to the selected sequent and derive the premises, adding them to the tree.
Add&nbsp;below        | If the selected sequent is at the root of the tree, this option will allow the user to grow the tree downwards, i.e. to generate a proof tree for a different conclusion by extending the current proof tree downwards. A prompt for the new conclusion will be displayed, and if a rule is found that can derive the current conclusion from the new one, the new conclusion will be added as the root of the tree.
Delete&nbsp;above     | Delete above simply removes any part of the proof tree above the current sequent and turns the current sequent into a premise
Delete&nbsp;below     | Delete below removes any part of the proof tree below the current sequent, making the current sequent the root/conclusion of the proof tree
Apply&nbsp;Cut        | If the calculus contains the cut rule (more specifically SingleCut), this option will prompt the user for a cut formula and then try to apply [proof search](#proof-search) to the two new branches introduced by the cut rule. If one or both proof trees cannot be found, that branch/branches will be added as a premise.


Next in main screen is the sidebar on the right. This sidebar contains all the assumptions and proof trees in this session as well as the loaded up macros. The proof trees and assumptions can be saved into a text file and loaded back up into the UI (Use __File__ > __Open...__ and __File__ > __Save/Save As...__ ). 

To add a sequent as an assumption, first type the sequent into the text input at the top and when the sequent is parsed, click on the `Add assm` button underneath the assumption list.

<table class="table" markdown="0">
<tr>
<td><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></td>
<td markdown="1">
In order to use assumptions in the `der` function and by extension the proof search, the `Prem` rule must be added to the JSON file. To do this, add the following declaration to the `calc_structure_rules` under `RuleZer`:

{% highlight json %}
"Prem" : {
    "ascii" : "Prem",
    "latex" : "Prem",
    "condition" : "(\\<lambda>x. seq = x)",
    "locale" : "Premise seq"
}
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight json %}
"Prem" : ["?X |- ?Y", ""]
{% endhighlight %}

to `RuleZer` in `rules`.

Lastly, type `Locale` (found in [template/Calc_Rules.thy](https://github.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/blob/master/template/Calc_Rules.thy)) must have the constructor `Premise Sequent`, since it is used by the `Prem` rule, as evidenced by the first code snippet.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The proof tree list holds all the added proof trees. To switch between them, simply double click on a proof tree in the list (the list labels are the conclusion sequents of each proof tree). Right clicking on an individual proof tree brings up the following drop-down menu:

![scala gui screenshot, pt list drop down menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/gh-pages/_files/scala_gui_screen4.png)

{: .table .table-responsive}
Add&nbsp;as&nbsp;assm       | Adds the root sequent of the selected proof tree to the list of assumptions
Delete                      | Deletes the selected proof tree (you can also delete a proof tree/list of proof trees by highlighting and pressing the Delete key on the keyboard )
Export&nbsp;to&nbsp;LaTeX   | Prompts the user to select a file name and then exports the selected proof tree to latex (the proof tree type setting requires [bussproofs.sty](http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/))
Copy&nbsp;as&nbsp;Isabelle  | Copies the entire proof tree into the clipboard (as a string). This proof tree can be pasted into an Isabelle theory file.
Create&nbsp;Rule&nbsp;Macro | Creates a macro form the selected prooftree. For more information, read the section on [locales](#locales-and-relaka).

Finally, the bottom bar contains buttons for loading locales and relAKA, if these are defined in the calculus. The specifics on [locales and relAKA](#locales-and-relaka) are documented in a separate section below. The `PT search depth` spinner sets the depth of the [proof tree search](#proof-search). The value of 5 returns a result in a reasonable time and as the search time for each extra level is roughly exponential, the search times beyond the value 7 are usually not practical for neither the minimal nor the D.EAK calculi.

The `Valid Prooftree` label indicates if the proof tree is valid, by running the `isProoftree` function every time the proof tree is changed or reloaded.

### LaTeX Typesetting

A big motivation for the UI tools was the difficult readability of the encoded calculus. The full D.EAK calculus, even with syntactic sugar, is already quite far removed form the LaTeX representation, however the real trouble comes with the encoding of the proof trees.

For demonstration, this is an encoding of a proof tree in Isabelle:
<pre>
<code> (Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> B<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ;<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''q'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleDisp ImpR_comma_disp2 [(B<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> →<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''q'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleStruct W_impR_L [(Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleZer RuleZer.Id  []]]</code>
</pre>

Even after formatting and lining up the code snippet above, the coding is still quite hard to read:

<pre>
<code> (Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> B<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ;<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''q'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleDisp ImpR_comma_disp2  
[(B<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> →<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''q'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleStruct W_impR_L
                      [(Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub> ⊢<sub>S</sub> Atprop ''p'' <sub>F</sub> <sub>S</sub>) ⟸ PT  RuleZer RuleZer.Id  []]]</code>
</pre>

When typeset in LaTeX however, the proof is readable immediately:

$$\frac{\displaystyle \frac
{p \vdash p}
{p > p \vdash q} }
{p \vdash p ; q}$$

Due to this, the UI was initially developed with the express intention of pretty printing the proof trees generated by the [proof search](#proof-search) algorithm. The reasons Scala was used for the UI were twofold. The main reason Scala was chosen was due to the fact that the code export tool in Isabelle supported exporting code to Scala. The second reason, tied to the need for a UI and LaTeX typesetting, was the ability of Scala to import and use Java libraries.  
The library used for LaTeX typesetting of the calculus terms is [JLaTeXMath](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/jlatexmath/). The library includes a subset of the available LaTeX packages and has so far been sufficient for all typesetting. The advantage of the library is the complete independence of the system version of LaTeX, as it is self contained. However, this library does not contain the [bussproofs.sty](http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/) style sheet. This meant that the proof trees inside the UI had to be laid out without the use of LaTeX. Another library, [TreeLayout](http://treelayout.sourceforge.net/), was used to layout the individual sequents into a proof tree in the UI. This approach, whilst more complicated than using LaTeX typesetting of the full proof trees, allowed for the easy addition of interactivity to the proof trees by adding context menus, as seen in the section above.

### Proof search

The proof search algorithm was initially implemented in Haskell and later migrated to Scala. Since both Haskell and Scala are functional programming languages, the proof search algorithm is extremely short, the core method body is only about 10 lines of code:

{% highlight scala %}
def derTrees(loc:List[Locale], n:Int, seq:Sequent):Option[Prooftree] = n match {
case 0 => None
case n => 
    for((rule, derList)<-derAll(loc, seq).sortWith(_._2.length < _._2.length)) {
        lazy val ders = derList.map(x => derTrees(loc, n-1, x))
        if(!ders.contains(None))
            return Some(Prooftreea(seq, rule, ders.map{case Some(pt) => pt}))
    }
    return None
}
{% endhighlight %}

Since the algorithm is very short, it will come as no surprise that it is quite a simple one. The function above simply gets a list of possible rules it can apply and it will recursively do so until reaching a premise or 'timing out'. The integer `n` in the method declaration is used as a counter to guarantee termination. If the counter reaches zero before a premise or a nullary rule is derived, the function will terminate with an unsuccessful result, the empty list. If a nullary rule or a premise is reached before this point, the search terminates and the found proof tree is added to the list.  

The proof search in its current form is useful for finding proof trees with about 5 levels. As the time complexity is exponential with search depth, the algorithm isn't feasible beyond the depth of 7. An auxiliary function is used to search for proof trees of ascending depth until a proof tree is found or the maximum depth is reached. 

The proof search functionality has much potential for improvement, mainly in reducing the search space for valid proof trees by a more directed search (one improvement might be taking reversible rules into consideration and disregarding the application of their reverse immediately succeeding said rule application, by keeping the history of applied rules in memory).

### Locales and relAKA

a Locale in the calculus toolbox is a special data type which carries extra information for rule derivation. The need for locales arises from the D.EAK calculus rules, some of which contain side conditions and rely on extra information for successful application (these are detailed in the [Calculus Encoding]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/calculus-encoding.html) section).  
The locales in the toolbox are somewhat similar to Isabelle's locales, which create an enclosed 'environment', where certain assumptions and conditions hold. This is the case for some proofs in the calculus, which are only valid under certain assumptions. The _isProofTree_ function therefore requires a list of locales, which it tries to use to successfully derive all the sequents of the proof tree in sequence. If a locale needed for a certain rule is missing, the proof tree will not be valid. Since the locales are user defined, the UI provides facilities for defining some of them. The current toolbox contains the following locales:

<br>

#### CutFormula 

This locale carries a formula which is used for the application of the [cut rule]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/calculus-encoding.html#cut). To apply cut in the UI, the user selects the __ApplyCut__
option when clicking on a sequent within a proof tree. The user is prompted to enter a cut formula, which is stored inside a CutFormulalocale and used in the _der_ function when applying the cut rule.

- - -

The CutFormula locale is needed for proof search, when growing the tree from the root to the premises. However, the _isProofTree_ function does not require the cut formulas found in the proof tree to be supplied in the list of locales, because it is easy to collect the cut formulas from the given proof tree (even if we do not know if it is valid beforehand). The _collectCutFormulas_ function (found in [Calc_Rules.thy](https://github.com/goodlyrottenapple/calculus-toolbox/blob/master/template/Calc_Rules.thy#L238-L245)) traverses the given proof tree and collects the cut formula at any level where the cut rule is applied (rather where the cut rule label is found). The cut formula is the formula, which is both the antecedent one premise and at the same time the consequent of the other one, as is clear from the rule itself:

$$Cut \frac{X \vdash A   \qquad   A \vdash Y}{X \vdash Y}$$

Once the cut rules have been collected into the locale list, the _isProofTree_ then recursively applies _der_ function, checking that the derivations at level are correct.

- - -

<br>

#### Premise

The premise locale has been introduced to allow user added premises. This can be especially useful in proof search, as the user can add sequents that are not axioms to the proof search, allowing a guided search which terminates at the user defined premise. The list of current premises can be found in the sidebar of the Scala UI, and premises can be added in several different ways, as documented in the sections above.  

{:.table}
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> |  Similarity to the CutRule locale, the premises in a concrete proof tree are collected by the _collectPremises_ function when _isProofTree_ is applied. This means that the premises act as axioms even though they may not actually be valid.

<br>

#### Empty

This is the base locale, added to the list of locales by default. Since a locale must always be supplied to the _der_ function, the empty locale signifies a locale with no extra information or assumptions. Since most rules of the minimal and the D.EAK calculus do not require locales, the rules can be applied with any given locale, including but not limited to the empty locale.

<br>

#### RelAKA

The relAKA locale is specific to the _Swapin_ and [_Swapout_]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/calculus-encoding.html#swapout) rules in the D.EAK calculus. These rules can only be applied in specific circumstances, or rather, only under under a certain relation of the current sequent's sub-terms (more specifically, it is a relation between an Action, Agent and a list of Actions). 

Defining a relAKA is a bit more involved in the UI, as this functionality was added last and is still somewhat experimental. To define a relAKA, create a text file called `relAKA.txt`. The file should contain entries of the form:

~~~
<alpha_1>, <a_1>, <beta_1>
<alpha_1>, <a_1>, <beta_2>
...
<alpha_2>, <a_2>, <beta_n>
...
~~~

This file can be modified and reloaded while the UI is running by clicking on the __Reload relAKA__ button in the bottom bar. In a future version of the UI, the creation and modification of the relAKA could be handled directly within the UI.

{:.table}
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> | Note that any proof trees which rely on a specific relAKA will only be valid if said relAKA is currently loaded in the UI

Perhaps confusingly, the __Load Locale__ button loads up a stored locale file, which currently only stores [rule macros]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/calculus-encoding.html#rule-macro). Whilst not part of the Locale definition, rule macros are similar to locales, since they are user defined additions to the calculus, which carry some extra information (i.e. the shape of a proof tree which can be applied to a concrete sequent). 

{:.table}
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> | To save a rule macro locale file, right click on any of the current rule macros and select __Save Macros__.

Because the locales and macros are currently stored and generated in a rather fragmented way (there are 3 separate files which individually store the assumptions, relAKAs and rule macros), possible improvements to the UI usability would include an overhaul of the interaction and generation of locales and store all the locales and macros in a single file.
